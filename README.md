# Wayvibes

Wayvibes is a Wayland-native CLI made in C++ that plays mechanical keyboard sounds (or custom sounds) globally on keypresses. It utilizes `libevdev` to capture keypress events and [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io) to play sounds.

## Installing

#### Prerequisites:
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `libevdev` (`libevdev-devel` on debian/fedora)
- `nlohmann-json` (`nlohmann-json-devel` on debian/fedora)
- ~`miniaudio`~ (`miniaudio.h` file is present in this project)

To install wayvibes, use the following commands: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhattkacode/wayvibes
cd wayvibes
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Add user to the `input` group by the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G input <your_username>
```

2. **Reboot** or **Logut and Login** for the changes to take effect.

3. Run the application:

```bash
wayvibes <soundpack_path> -v <volume(0.0-10.0)>
```

**Example:** 

```bash
wayvibes ~/wayvibes/akko_lavender_purples/ -v 3
```

#### Note:
- Default **Soundpack Path:** `./`
- Default **Volume:** `1`

### Keyboard Device Configuration
Upon the first run, Wayvibes will prompt you to select your keyboard device if there are multiple available. This selection will be stored in:

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wayvibes/input_device_path`

Typically, the input device will be something like `AT Translated Set 2 keyboard` or `USB Keyboard`. If you use a key remapper like `keyd`, select its virtual device (e.g., `keyd virtual keyboard`).

To reset and prompt for input device selection again, use:

```bash 
wayvibes --prompt
```

**Note that input device will change after reboot if you plug in/out any other device, so use --prompt when this happens**


### **Important**:
**Do not run the program with root privileges as it will monopolize the audio device until reboot.**

## Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhattkacode/wayvibes
cd wayvibes
g++ -o wayvibes main.cpp -levdev
sudo cp wayvibes /usr/local/bin # to add the executable to PATH
```

## Get Soundpacks

Wayvibes is compatible with the Mechvibes soundpack format. So, You can find soundpacks from the following sources:

- [Mechvibes Soundpacks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PimUN_Qn3CWqfn-93YdVW8OWy8nzpz3w3me41S8S494)
- [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/MMVrhWxa4w) (got akko_lavender_purples soundpack from here)

### Note:
Some soundpacks with single audio file configuration won't work, use [this tool](https://github.com/KunalBagaria/packfixer-rustyvibes) to convert them into a compatible format

## Why Wayvibes?

Unlike [mechvibes](https://mechvibes.com) and [rustyvibes](https://github.com/KunalBagaria/rustyvibes), which encounter [issues](https://github.com/KunalBagaria/rustyvibes/issues/23) on Wayland, Wayvibes aims to provide a seamless integration with wayland.
